<h1> a proposal and self reflection - izh </h1>


>*As an A student with a love of drawing and crafting, I spent my K–12 years being told art was a nice hobby. Art skills had nothing to do with science or math success, and engineering was something you went into only if you did well in math and science first. Succeeding in STEM subjects, which weren’t called STEM at that point, seemed more important. When I was in high school in D.C., there was never much choice between taking studio art and calculus—if you were clever, you took the latter, knowing that anything with art in the title was sure to be useless to your career and college aspirations. “Design” was never an offered subject, much less a subtopic for discussion, and I never considered it as a career path, because I had no idea it was a career path.*

Unless you were lucky enough to have grown up in a family that not only was artistic, but chose to pursue the field professionally, I think we can all relate to this. It doesn't seem to matter where you are situated geographically; the general concensus is that artists are poor and only make money in their death, apparently. But personally, I don't think it takes a genius to make the link between each aspect of the STEM acronym, and the creativity it can or should demand, hence why I - and many others - believe that **STEAM** is more appropriate.

To put it simply, **STEM** cannot exist without **ART**. Art in STEM typically comes in the form of diagrams, however the two fields can intertwine even further in order to create beautiful installations whether that be something temporary and conceptual, or permanent and rigid. There are infinite examples that support the concept of Art and STEM being undivided in areas, namely the thought processes required by each. Maths and Art both demand spacial reasoning skills and an ability to recognise patterns. Sciene and Art both involve observation and interpretation. Since Technology and Engineering are simply branches of maths and science, these too will possess the same overlap.

After having used Arduino (and loved it), my lens of what art and design can be was broadened. I had used similar equipment and interfaces earlier during my school life, through physics lessons and information technology lessons using Scratch and Logo, but never within the context of a creative art lesson. These subjects were manufactured for the purpose of producing applied physicists, technicians, and computer scientists.

I think the problem is that the general public fail to see how the Arts and STEM subjects are far less dichotomous than they are made out to be (I could then go on to explain how this is the result of capitalism the same way almost every social issue is and the fact that we are living within a perpetual arms-race, but that would drive me slightly off-topic as this is meant to be physical computing related). **Lateral thinking** simply isn't valued enough from the ages of 10 to perhaps 16, and even this is dependent on the subjects taken and teachers one had. For example, I would argue that a chef is simply a scientist who specialises in the edible. Baking is mostly chemistry. Yeast are simply single-celled microorganisms that expel carbon dioxide. This is what makes bread rise. Although a breadboard is likley only called a breadboard as it looks as such, I'd like to reach and suggest that they share a name as they are both basic in form yet cruicial components of their respective fields' excecution.

Similarly, creative computing can be viewed as an art form in itself, much like many other subjects. Using the Arduino boards demanded attention to detail as it's so intricate, and after completing each circuit I felt as satisfied as I do once I finish an oil painting.

<h2> physical computing + fine art in practice </h2>


A stunning example of physical computing within art can be seen at The Saatchi Gallery, in the work of CSM Fine Art MA Grad Louise Ward Morris' three-channel video installation titled "Total Parts". A trio of breakout boards including their attached wires are displayed alongside two JVC televisions, and a third monitor.

It could be argued that a portion of my stance is merely the fruit of my status as an "artist" and my insecurity derived from being the very first in my entire family of surgeons, dentists, actuaries and accountants etc to pursue a career within the creative field. Although on the flipside of this, my father, a dentist, possesses a degree of manual dexterity and eye for facial aesthetics that would be valued, if not sought after, within the arts. Despite the fact that my mother is officially an accountant, she has an artistic streak within her too, that is expressed through her makeup artistry. I thought that my cousin was pursuing illustration for a solid few months before actually asking. At the time he was studying, and now he's an actuary. So perhaps many individuals in my family had the potential, but as Anna Feldman stated, they never knew it was a career path, because it was never presented to them as a career path. Even less so due to our culture. Regardless, I am grateful that my family have supported me wholeheartedly in my pursuit of something that I genuinely find fulfilling. I always worried that there wasn't enough overlap between the lateral and logical in either one field (med/art), but GCD will allow for me to explore both methods of thinking while leaning towards the creative side. I will certainly be exploring physical/creative computing more in the future.
